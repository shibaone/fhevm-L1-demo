# Demo of fhEVM + KMS (centralized)

This documentation purpose is to show how to run fhEVM for FHE execution and KMS for async decryption and reencryption. 


 ## Key generation

 Please update `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`. Default is `false`

| KEY_GEN | Purpose                                                                       |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| true    | FHE keys are generated on the fly in res/keys (requires at elast 15GB of RAM) |
| false   | FHE keys are copied from kms-service-dev image in res/keys                    |




## Fast run and test

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Init node and copy or gen fhe keys
make init-ethermint-node
# Run fhEVM + full KMS components 
make run-full
# Deploy ACL, Gateway ..., please wait until the end before testing!!!
make prepare-e2e-test
# This test will fail (first event catch is buggy - we are on it)
make run-async-test
# This one is working
make run-async-test
# A non trivial test
make run-true-input-async-test
# Manual test
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint32'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint64'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt several addresses'
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you get `override the existing name orchestrator [y/N]: `, just ^C and  run `make clean-node-storage` to remove the state.

# Init fhEVM

```bash
make init-ethermint-node 
```

Initialize and generate/copy FHE keys based on `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`.

> [!NOTE]  
> If KEY_GEN is set to `false`, ensure to have 15 GB of empty RAM to generate the keys. On Mac, do not forget to increase the allocated RAM to docker process. 

## Run fhEVM + KMS components

```bash
make run-full
# Check the logs for the node
docker logs zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1 -f
# Check logs for Gateway
docker logs zama-dev-gateway-1 -f     
```

You should see the following docker images:

```
zama-dev-gateway-1		            ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:aa90d98
zama-dev-kms-connector-1		    ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-connector-dev:50872c4
zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1		    ghcr.io/zama-ai/ethermint-node:v0.5.0
zama-dev-kms-core-1		            ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-service-dev:aa90d98
zama-dev-gateway-store-1		    ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:aa90d98
zama-dev-kms-validator-1		    ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-asc-dev:50872c4
```

## Stop fhEVM + KMS 

```bash
make stop-full
```

## Fresh start

```bash
make clean
```

> [!NOTE]  
> FHE keys are in res/keys folder, delete them to regenerate new keys at ```make init-ethermint-node``` step.


## Test using fhevm

```bash
# if not executed before
make init-ethermint-node 
# if not executed before
make run-full
# In new terminal
make run-e2e-test
```

or in one command 

```bash
make e2e-test
```
